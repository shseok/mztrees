Mztrees is a website where anyone can share and check out unique or useful sites.

We want to share trendy or useful sites scattered across the vast Internet, exchange feedback, and provide diversity of information.

Since we have currently applied a responsive layout, you can access the site and experience the service on mobile devices.
